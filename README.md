# Jonah A. Miranda

This is my about me project.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/abf6e83f-c185-4fa1-a22b-e34fd1281225/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-jonahmiranda-1/deploys) 

## About the Project  


The project was challenging overall but seeing the product I turned in left me with a sigh of relief. I pushed myself to create something I was proud of and through all the frustration, I was able to implement hover effects, variable fonts, and a sliding underline to my nav bar. I struggled with and was not able to implement a hamburger icon although I did get it to open and close the way I wanted to in mobile view.

 
## Color Scheme

My color scheme for this project consisted of:

```rgb(0, 0, 0);
```rgb(255, 255, 255);
```rgb(255, 0, 0);
```rgb(17, 22, 89);

```

I chose these colors because they matched the theme of my logo and were very easy on the eyes. In terms of readability, I believe my project was a success.
