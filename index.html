         <h2>Working Title</h2>

         <div>
            <p>"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but
               because you have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when
               you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the
               eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be
               all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
               sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that
               can never be; but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post
               this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking--I must
               attend to my husband! "Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home
               with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air
               would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
               life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think
               I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I
               am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives,
               and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever. He tells me
               that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more than he
               did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your
               loving</p>

            <p>20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there are
               spells of cessation from his passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent.
               Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: "Now I can wait;
               now I can wait." The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was
               still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face,
               and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might almost say, "cringing"--softness. I was
               satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but
               finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour
               enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
               furtively at them:--</p>

            <p>"They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!"</p>

            <p>It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor
               madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have
               anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me
               some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he
               will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only
               say: "I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait."</p>

            <p>After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that
               then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which
               exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma. ... Three nights has the same thing
               happened--violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the
               cause. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went. Happy thought! We
               shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall
               escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are
               required.... 23 August.--"The unexpected always happens." How well Disraeli knew life. Our bird when
               he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we
               have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able
               to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut
               him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul's body will
               enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called; the
               patient has once more escaped. Later.--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
               attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I
               sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we
               found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious,
               and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him
               a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked
               round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could
               trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
               ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as
               if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every
               instant, and presently said:--</p>
