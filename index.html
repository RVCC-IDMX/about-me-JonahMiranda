            <p>Hello! My name is Jonah Alexander Miranda.
               I am 23 years old and was born in Edison, NJ. I have lived in both New Jersey and Florida. I have 5
               brothers and 1 sister. Growing up, I played baseball and basketball. I joined the Army Reserves as an
               Intelligence Analyst when I was 17 and have since been on two deployments, one to Iraq and one to Qatar.
               Currently, I am attending Raritan Valley Community College studying to get my Associates of Applied
               Science in Information Systems and Technology. My end goal is to work in cleared government spaces doing
               IT.
            </p>

         <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>

         <p>Lately, I have seen that I am interested in a lot more than I was pre-Covid. As mentioned, I have always
            liked basketball and baseball, but Covid has given me an appreciation for many other things as well. Because
            of the lack of sports being televised during 2020's pandemic, I became an avid UFC fan and can now say that
            MMA is my favorite sport. During the pandemic I also started riding motorcycles and have owned 4 since 2020
            (1 sports bike and 3 cruisers). The pandemic has also allowed me to reconnect with my brothers living in
            Florida because we started gaming together and would chat there. A lot of the rest of my free time is spent
            at the gym, playing basketball, shooting guns (at a controlled range), and going out with my friends. Of
            course any other free time I have is expended on going to work and doing homework.</p>

      <!-- my blog - what i learned about variable fonts -->
      <article id="blog">

         <h2 class="text">My Blog: Variable Fonts</h2>

         <div>
            <p>The topic I chose to write about is Variable Fonts. Using variable fonts allow you to enable many
               different variations of font to be used in a single file instead of having to use multiple files to
               adjust the aspects of your font. Using a variable font is beneficial because it allows you to use these
               different styles and sizes of fonts to be adjusted for better readability on your webpage. While you may
               want a header and body paragraph to be the same font, you might not want them to be the same size or
               color. With variable fonts you can adjust this to your liking and even add visual effects to your text.
               When setting an axis of variation, it is important to remember the size you want your text displayed at.
               This sets a permissible range for the text to be displayed.</p>

            <p>Using the @font-face rule lets you set what you want the text font to be and set the weight of that font
               as well. You can import fonts from sites such as google fonts and use those fonts by means of the
               @font-face. For my example I used the Avenir font and coupled that with an animation delay and font
               color. Using the effects, I was able to display my font to change colors and animate vertically. Setting
               the animation text flow to infinite allowed the color changing to never stop running.</p>

            <p>What I also used in my variable fonts CSS was the @keyframes rule. The keyframes CSS rule defines a texts
               style and gives it a waypoint for animation. The keyframes rule gives you more control of your animation
               rather than using the transitions sequence option. The word you give after using the @keyframes rule is
               the animation you set your text to display. In my code, I used the text-flow animation coupled with a
               transform on the Y axis which moves my text vertically.</p>

            <p>Some struggles I faced when implementing variable fonts was adjusting the speed and smoothness of my
               animation. I found that I added nth-child rules to ten different colors, but my text was only displaying
               2 different colors. The speed was a challenge because I was not sure how the timing worked between
               changing it for the color and the up and down movement. The smoothness was difficult to figure out, I
               tried adjusting so that it would transition smoother up and down, but my animation stayed a little too
               choppy. I thought I would be able to change that using the transform options in my @keyframes but it did
               not allow me to do so.</p>
